FusionDirectory attribute & Objectclass finder
==============================================

To be able to find at wich version an attribute / objectclass has been added / deprecated or removed we wrote a web application that allow you to search based on various criteria.

Those criteria are :

 * Attributes
 * ObjectClass
 * Release
 * Schemas

The application is available on `Schema <https://schemas.fusiondirectory.info/>`_
