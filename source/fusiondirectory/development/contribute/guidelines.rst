Coding with style

Git Commit Messages
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. note::

   Having a good guideline for creating commits and sticking to it makes
   working with Git and collaborating with others a lot easier.

Here are some rules of thumb :

-  Use the present tense ("Add feature" not "Added feature")
-  If you have a body, separate the subject from the body with a newline
-  Limit the subject line to 72 characters
-  Do not end the subject line with a period
-  Use imperative
   `mood <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imperative_mood#English>`__ in
   the subject line
-  If the subject is not clear enough, use the body to explain what and
   why as opposed to how
-  Consider starting the commit message with an applicable emoji, when
   you feel it's an important commit :

.. code-block:: shell

   :tada:      When first / initial commit
   :sparkles:  When introducing new features
   :ambulance: When fixing a bug
   :handshake: When merging files
   :tractor:   When you changing file structure or refactoring
   :books:     When writing docs
   :gem:       When new Release
   :lipstick:  For cosmetics purposes

Commit Message Format
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Each commit message consists of a **header**, a **body** and a
**footer**. The header has a special format that includes a **type**, a
**scope** and a **subject**:

::

   <emoji> <type>(<scope>): <subject>
   <BLANK LINE>
   <body>
   <BLANK LINE>
   <footer>

The **header** is mandatory and the **scope** of the header is optional.

Where type can be :

-  **feat**: A new feature
-  **fix**: A bug fix
-  **core**: Code for the Core
-  **docs**: Documenting the code or writing new documentation
-  **style**: Cosmetics purpose
-  **test**: Adding missing or correcting tests

Examples:

::

   :sparkles: feat(supann): Make supannRefId multivaluated

   supannRefId on Structure object is too small and mono valued

   close #5685
