Source Code management
======================

FusionDirectory source code management is handled by `GIT <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Git>`_ and hosted on `GitHub <https://github.com/fusiondirectory>`_.

There is two repositories :

* `FusionDirectory Core <https://gitlab.fusiondirectory.org/fusiondirectory/fd>`_
* `FusionDirectory plugins <https://gitlab.fusiondirectory.org/fusiondirectory/fd-plugins>`_

In order to contribute to the source code, you will have to know a few things about Git and the development model we follow.

Branches
--------

On the Git repository, you will  find several existing branches:

* `master` contains latest released official code,
* `xxx-fixes` contains the next minor release source code,
* `xxx-dev` contains the next major release source-code,

The `xxx-dev` branch is where new features are added. This code is reputed as **non stable**.

The `xxx-fixes` branches is where bugs are fixed. This code is reputed as *stable*.
